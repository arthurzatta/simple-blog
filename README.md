### Todo
- Database conection with mongodb (their object style can be a benefit here because of the content simplicity)

- Database:
    - [x] Connection and configuration(mongodb)
      - What happened? 
        - The server doesn't connect with database, I'm not sure if this is because of values used for host and ports.
