### Todo
- Database conection with mongodb (their object style can be a benefit here because of the content simplicity)

    - [ ] Posts
    - [ ] Tags

    - [ ] Needs to return all the posts
    - [ ] Can be possible to create new posts
    - [ ] Delete and update the posts
    - [ ] Do the samethings with tags
    - [ ] Try to deploy(maybe heroku)
    - [ ] Understand how to make a panel only for my access without login or if I need to make new posts directly on backend, maybe use some markdown and commit them to github for use as base of posts
    - [ ] Possibilitie of insert images

- React:
    - [ ] Pagination
    - [ ] Maybe use proxy functions 
    - [ ] Immutabilitie
